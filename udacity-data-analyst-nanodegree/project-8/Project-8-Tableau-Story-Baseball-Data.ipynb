This assured that we can distinguish differences between groups of different sample sizes. I also added a bubble chart to top right corner to show the amount of different groups. This bubble chart also functions as filter view. However, adding this view, left bottom view wider. Therefore, I transpose the graph to efficiently allocate space.\n",
